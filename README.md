# PyBer_Analysis

#Overview#
 The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary of ride-sharing data by city type. 
 We will plot this data using multiple line graph and show the total weekly fares for 
 each city type. We will also make recommendations on how to best interpret this data 
 and recommendations on how to use this data. 
 
 #Results#
 Each city type has different average daily rides and fares. The type that is the busiest 
 is Urban with 2405 drivers averaging $16.57 per ride. Suburban is second with 490 drivers 
 averaging $39.50 per ride. And finally rural with 78 drivers avergining $55.49 per ride. 
 The average fare per ride is $24.53 for urban trips, $30.97 for suburban, and $34.62 for rural  
 
 
 
 #Summary#
 Based on the above data I would recommend focusing on reducing the number of drivers in urban 
 cities to be more in line with the other city types of drivers available relative to total rides. 
Second I would recommend starting programs that make trips more appealing to suburban and rural 
riders and drivers. There could be incentives offered to urban drives to be available for suburban 
and rural cities and increase advertisement in those cities.
